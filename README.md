# Paste-Code-Anywhere

With this Pyhton Program, you can paste code anywhere where it is restricted to do so.

For me personally, I like working in my own IDE which I get used to and when certain sites remove an option to paste or restrict you from pasting stuff, I get frustrated and to add even more some sites actually block extensions as well

So, this is the perfect solution for such situtation.
Work in an IDE that you are used to and paste it at any desired location ( even if its restricted )
